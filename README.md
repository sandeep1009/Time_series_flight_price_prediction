# Time_series_flight_price_prediction
Overview
Welcome to the Time Series Flight Prediction ML Model GitHub project! This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting flight time series data using various techniques and algorithms. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, handling categorical data, and implementing different regression models like RandomForestRegressor, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. The results are visualized with interactive Plotly graphs to provide insightful analysis.

git clone https://github.com/sandeep1009/Time_series_flight_price_prediction.git


Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebooks to understand the data, perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and build ML models for flight prediction.
Data
The data used in this project can be found in the data/ directory. It contains historical flight records with various features like departure time, arrival time, airline, origin, destination, etc.

Data Cleaning
Before building the prediction model, we perform data cleaning to handle missing values, remove outliers, and ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a crucial step in building a predictive model. We extract relevant features from the raw data and create new features to enhance the model's performance.

Modeling
We employ three regression models in this project: RandomForestRegressor, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. These models are trained on the processed data to predict flight time series.

Results
The results of each model are presented in the Jupyter notebooks and visualized . These visualizations provide a better understanding of the model's predictions and feature importance.
